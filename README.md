# odin-project-admin-dashboard
This is the admin dashboard project from TOP(the odin project) Intermediate: HTML and CSS course.

This project is about building a full dashboard design using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The website will consist of a main html index page, a css page and javascript page.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my knowledge around css grid and flexbox.

Self-reflection and conclusion: This project was a great opportunity to train my grid skills and my flexbox skills.
The layout was overwhealming at first but with persistence I was able to complete it, the secret is to start by dividing the layout into pieces and complete first layers and as soon as the layer is correct, then we can dive deep into the nested elements.
