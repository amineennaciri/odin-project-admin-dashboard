# odin-project-admin-dashboard
This is the admin dashboard project from TOP(the odin project) Intermediate: HTML and CSS course.

This project is about building a full dashboard design using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The website will consist of a main html index page, a css page and javascript page.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my knowledge around css grid and flexbox.

Self-reflection and conclusion: 

# current step
Taking it one section at a time, begin nesting child elements under the parent elements in the HTML. Remember that you can keep making grid containers within grid containers.

In the sidebar, use more grids to lay out the navigation and branding sections.

In the header, use more grids to lay out the search bar, user info and buttons.

For the main-content, use more grids to lay out the projects, announcements and trending items.

Fill out some dummy content and placeholder images so you can position all of your grid items.
